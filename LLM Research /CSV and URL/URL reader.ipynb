       "[Document(page_content='You are here:\\n\\nHome\\n\\nTOP TEN\\n\\nTop 5 Zoro’s Future Opponents\\n\\nTop 5 Zoro’s Future Opponents\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nBefore he becomes the world’s greatest swordsman, Zoro needs to have a real sword fight. By that, I mean a fight determined by the quickness and subtlety of the blade. I understand that Haki attacks that cut ships and cliffs are cool. But what I would love to see is a fight where every stroke of the blade can dismember limbs or necks, where Zoro barely dodges a thrust and responds with a slice that his opponent paries at just the right time.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nThroughout the series, Zoro’s fights have demonstrated his strength, resolve, and power. His swordsmanship, however has only been demonstrated through these moments where he cuts through powerful bodies or attacks. Ironically, if his opponents will be as strong as he is, then the way to make the fights interesting is classical swordsmanship. Dual weild presents some good opportunities as patterns of movement (interchanging high and low slashes, for example) can make for clever attacks. An opponent can get used to a pattern and is then surprised by a sudden switch. Using his mouth sword as a feint to lure his opponent to a low angle slash could also be cool.\\n\\nNow let’s take a look at Zoro’s possible future opponents.\\n\\n5. THE NEXT USER OF KIRA KIRA NO MI\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nWhen Zoro was finally able to cut Daz Bones (Mr. 1), he asked to Zoro: “What’s next? Cutting diamonds?”Now that line holds a lot of foreshadowing as we have learned in the Marineford War Arc that a certain Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates holds the ability to turn into diamond… And we all know Oda doesn’t just throw things out there for nothing.There will be a point in the series where Zoro will have to go head to head against Diamond Jozu?Personally I can’t believe that any of the Straw Hats will fight someone of the remnant Whitebeard Pirates. Does this mean Jozu will die at some point and Zoro will fight the next owner of his devil fruit?\\n\\n4. FUJITORA\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nIn terms of combat strength, Fujitora is considered to be one of the strongest fighters within the entire World Government structure.He ate the Zushi Zushi no Mi, a\\xa0Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him the to manipulate gravity around a chosen location at will by sending gravitational forces. Fujitora can manipulate gravitational forces by channeling his Devil Fruit ability through his sword. He can send the gravitational forces by swinging or just simply moving his sword.Fujitora has also shown mastery over two types of Haki: Armament Haki and Observation Haki, which he uses to compensate for his blindness in battle.The fight between Fujitora and Zoro was anticipated in Dressrosa, where they clashed. Zoro defeating Fujitora in a duel would be a remarkable feat to add to his resume.\\n\\n3. SHIRYU OF THE RAIN\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nShiryu has eaten the Suke Suke no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit which gives him the ability to turn himself and other things invisible. With this fruit, he is able to cut opponents without being spotted, taking them by surprise.Surely Shiryu has an advantage against lower level enemies, but Observation Haki users should remain unfazed by his invisibility.Apparently Shiryu made a mistake choosing Suke Suke no Mi but its Awakening form could allow him not to turn everything around him invisible like some of the Paramecia devil fruits we have seen but instead it erases every trace of the user including it’s presence. This would make this fruit the perfect match for a blood killer like Shiryu.Zoro will have to push his Observation Haki to its peak to defeat Shiryu.\\n\\n2. THE OLDEST LOOKING GOROSEI\\n\\nHe is bald, much like\\xa0Mahatma Gandhi. He is the only one of the five to not wear a black suit or tie. He also holds a samurai sword with him. According to some popular theories, that Gorosei possesses a Kitetsu.At the moment we know nothing about their powers and backstories but I do believe that all of them have fighting powers:-They all have battle scars.-He has one of the greatest swords, if he doesn’t know how to fight why would he go through all the trouble of getting it.-In the One Piece world, power rules. To become Fleet Admiral you have to be Admiral first, and to do that you need to have Haki and etc.. you get the idea.My point is that Gorosei has great fighting power, probably even greater than an Admiral.\\n\\n1. DRACULE MIHAWK\\n\\nThere is only one swordsman who Zoro aims to defeat in order to become the world’s best swordsman and that is none other than Dracule Mihawk, the current holder of the title, “Greatest Swordsman in the World”. Part of Mihawk’s reputation as the most powerful master swordsman in the world is also due to his tremendous superhuman physical power and fortitude which supplements his mastery of swordsmanship. An throughout all of One Piece series Mihawk didn’t get hurt even once!In the past he was a rival to Shanks, when Shanks still got both arms. Having lost one rival in Shanks, he now shares a rivalry with Zoro, and is prepared to wait as long as it takes for Zoro to become strong enough to beat him.\\n\\nSee more\\n\\nPrevious article Why Aokiji should be the World’s Most Wanted Man\\n\\nNext article Artificial Intelligence imagines Red Hair Pirates in Real Life\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nin TOP TENTop 10 Strongest Marines In One Piece Series  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENAll One Piece Villains Ranked from Least Evil to Most Evil  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENTOP 50 Highest Known Bounties Ever in One Piece!

       " Document(page_content='You are here:\\n\\nHome\\n\\nTOP TEN\\n\\nAll 12 Confirmed Devil Fruit Users of The Blackbeard Pirates Crew\\n\\nAll 12 Confirmed Devil Fruit Users of The Blackbeard Pirates Crew\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nThe Blackbeard Pirates are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate fleet led by their admiral, Marshall D. Teach, better known as “Blackbeard”, one of the Four Emperors and one of the main antagonist groups of the series. They have been hunting and stealing Devil Fruit powers to increase their crew’s overall strength, making a name for themselves as Ability User Hunters.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nMarshall D. Teach, better known as “Blackbeard” has performed the incredible feat of landing a permanent scar on Red-Haired Shanks, who is famed as one of the Four Emperors in the world, prior to eating a Devil Fruit, as well as defeating two of the division commanders of the Whitebeard Pirates, Portgas D. Ace and Thatch. Teach ate one of the most powerful known Logia-type Devil Fruits, the Yami Yami no Mi, said to be the “most evil”, and held the position of a Warlord of the Sea, until he forfeited the title after he used it to reach Impel Down and recruit the prisoners mentioned above. With the assistance of his crew, Blackbeard ganged up on Whitebeard with a barrage of gunshots and stabs and killed him in a rather cowardly fashion.He somehow acquired the power of the Gura Gura no Mi from Whitebeard’s corpse, which is said to be the strongest Paramecia-type Devil Fruit, making him the only known person in history to wield two Devil Fruit powers at the same time. Along with his extensive knowledge of Whitebeard’s sphere of influence, the Five Elders have deemed him the likeliest candidate for usurping the deceased Whitebeard’s place as one of the Four Emperors; a prediction which came true following Blackbeard’s devastating victory over Marco and the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nVan Augur, the sniper, has tremendous marksmanship skill, being able to shoot a flock of seagulls from a distance so far, the Straw Hats Pirates could not even see the island he was on. He is able to predict where a bullet is going to hit and can run at an amazing speed to avoid it. Augur has now (post-time skip) become captain of Blackbeard’s third ship and gained the Wapu Wapu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to teleport himself and others from place to place.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nJesus Burgess, the helmsman, is a wrestling champion who possess incredible strength. In terms of hand-to-hand combat, Burgess is also an immensely powerful and skilled wrestler. His wrestling attacks such as elbow strikes and lariats can generate massive, air pressure-based shockwaves that can demolish buildings with great ease. He has gained the Riki Riki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants him superhuman strength. This enhances Burgess already immense strength to the point where he can casually lift a mountain over his head and throw it a far distance.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nDoc Q, the doctor, and his horse, Stronger, despite both being stricken with chronic sickness, are an extremely powerful duo. Being exceptionally skilled in cavalry combat, Doc Q and Stronger rely on perfect teamwork and coordination with Stronger galloping towards enemies at high speed while carrying Doc Q who strikes enemies down with his double-bladed scythe.Doc Q has now (post-time skip) become captain of Blackbeard’s ninth ship and gained the Shiku Shiku no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows Doc Q to afflict others with diseases. The diseases can take many forms, such as one that turns males into females. They can also be contagious, allowing them to spread among a group of enemies.The Uma Uma no Mi, Model: PegasusStronger now has the Uma Uma no Mi, Model: Pegasus, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into a Pegasus hybrid and a full Pegasus at will. This grants Stronger the power of flight.\\n\\nShiryu of the Rain, the former Head Jailer of Impel Down, is a fearsome master swordsman, having used his sword to kill many Impel Down prisoners on mere whims. When his sword was returned to him after his long-term imprisonment, Shiryu immediately killed several of his ex-subordinates in a split second, demonstrating great precision and dexterity in his swordsmanship. As former Head Jailer of Impel Down, Shiryu held one of the highest ranks in the fortress. During his time in Impel Down, Shiryu was said to be equal in strength to the Warden himself, Magellan, and since the latter’s bowel issues restricted his active time in the prison, Shiryu was deemed to be more dangerous.Shiryu has become captain of Blackbeard’s second ship. He has also acquired the Suke Suke no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gives its user the ability to turn themselves and whatever they touch (living or nonliving) invisible, making them a Clear Human.\\n\\nSanjuan Wolf, the “Colossal Battleship”, is the largest giant who has ever lived, courtesy of a currently unnamed Paramecia-type Devil Fruit. Wolf has now (post-time skip) become the captain of the seventh ship of Blackbeard’s fleet.\\n\\nAvalo Pizarro, also known as the “Corrupt King”, is currently the captain of the Fourth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.Pizarro ate the Shima Shima no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to assimilate his body into an island itself. Once assimilated, he can control both the natural environment and any artificial structures.\\n\\nSanjuan Wolf is an enormous giant, known as “Colossal Battleship” for his size. He’s the captain of the Seventh Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.Wolf ate the Deka Deka no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that makes him much bigger than normal giants. Despite being weak against water, he was tall enough to stand in the ocean, though Wolf did mention that doing so was exhausting to him, probably due to the Devil Fruit he had eaten.\\n\\nVasco Shot, monikered “Heavy Drinker”, is the captain of the Eighth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.Next to nothing is yet known about what Shot is capable of in combat. Shot ate the Gabu Gabu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit with alcohol-based powers that are currently unknown.\\n\\nCatarina Devon, the “Crescent Moon Hunter”, is the worst female criminal in history. She is a ruthless killer that collects the severed heads of beautiful women.Devon ate the Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Kyubi no Kitsune, giving her the ability to transform into and assume the abilities of a nine-tailed fox, which include shapeshifting. Devon has now become the captain of the sixth ship of Blackbeard’s fleet.\\n\\nKuzan, better known by his former epithet Aokiji, is a former Marine admiral and the first one to be revealed. He was nominated by Sengoku for the position of fleet admiral. However, after losing the position to Sakazuki, he resigned from the Marines. He has currently affiliated himself with the Blackbeard Pirates for unknown reasons.Combat-wise, Kuzan is among the strongest characters to have appeared in the series. From what has been seen of it, Kuzan’s physical prowess is immense, as befitting an admiral. Arguably the greatest-yet testament to his strength (though remaining unseen) is his duel against Akainu, wherein he matched his extremely strong adversary for a total of ten days until he suffered his defeat, bespeaking a tremendous deal of raw power, strength of will, endurance, and stamina.Kuzan ate the Hie Hie no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into ice.\\n\\nSee more\\n\\nPrevious article 10 Reunions that One Piece Fans can’t wait to see!\\n\\nNext article Is Hibari the Daughter of Akainu?\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nin TOP TENTop 10 Strongest Marines In One Piece Series  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENAll One Piece Villains Ranked from Least Evil to Most Evil  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENTOP 50 Highest Known Bounties Ever in One Piece!

It was created by gathering and compressing the poisonous H2S gas that spread throughout Punk Hazard and using Vegapunk’s process of Zoan devil fruit animation to bring it to life.Smiley consumed the Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl, which allowed it to take on the form of an axolotl. It is also what gave Smiley life and sentience. However, given its unique composition, it is very likely that it could only assume a hybrid form and not a full-beast form.\\n\\n#MONET\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nMonet was a scout and assistant for Caesar Clown and his underlings in the research facility on Punk Hazard. She had her original human arms and legs replaced with bird limbs, giving her an appearance resembling a harpy. She was, in truth, a member and officer of the Donquixote Pirates and was sent as a deep cover agent by Doflamingo. She was also the older sister of Sugar.Monet ate the Yuki Yuki no Mi, a Logia-class Devil Fruit which allowed her to become and control the element of snow. She could produce and manipulate snow, forming solid snow barriers. She also had the ability to make someone fall asleep by hugging them with her icy body which causes their body temperature to lower and leaving them weakened. She could also trap her enemies in snow and transform herself into a huge snow monster.\\n\\n#MOTHER CARAMEL\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nMother Carmel was a child trafficker dealing in orphans who operated in the Underworld several decades ago, under the code name “Mountain Witch”. Running an orphanage known as the “Sheep’s House”, her seemingly benevolent nature caused her to be known as the “Holy Mother”. In reality, she sold her orphan wards to the World Government every two years to be trained as Marines or Cipher Pol agents, until she met her end 63 years ago. Notably, she took care of a young Charlotte Linlin, who would later go on to become the Yonko Big Mom.Carmel ate the Soru Soru no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to manifest and manipulate the souls of herself and other people. She was shown manifesting her own soul and putting a fragment of it in a rampaging fire to create a sun homie named Pandora, subduing the flames to save an Elbaf village. The powers of the fruit were later seen manifested in Charlotte Linlin after Carmel’s disappearance.\\n\\n#DONQUIXOTE ROSINANTE\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nDonquixote Rosinante was formerly a World Noble of the Donquixote Family descent and the younger brother of Donquixote Doflamingo. After his family lost their status as Celestial Dragons and became pariahs, Rosinante became an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates, serving under Doflamingo under the codename Corazon. The truth, however, was that he was a Marine Commander, working undercover in order to stop Doflamingo. He was found out by the former Corazon, Vergo, and was executed by Doflamingo 13 years ago.Rosinante ate the Nagi Nagi no Mi, that granted him the power to create an invisible soundproof field. Anyone inside the field cannot hear the sounds from the outside and vice versa. With this power he could deceive Doflamingo to make him think he was mute, since no one in the Donquixote Pirates knew that he had this ability. The use of this power gave him great advantage on his job of a Marine informant.\\n\\n#PORTGAS D. ACE\\n\\nPortgas D. Ace was the son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger and his lover, Portgas D. Rouge. Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates and one-time captain of the Spade Pirates. Hunted by the World Government for his lineage, Ace was captured and sentenced to death, which resulted in the Battle of Marineford in an all out clash of powers. Ace was freed, but he sacrificed his life to protect his younger brother from Akainu.Ace ate the Devil Fruit Mera Mera no Mi, a Logia-type fruit that allows him to become the element of fire and control the flames from his body, giving him his reputation as “Fire Fist Ace”. His main style is to launch columns of fire by punching, with his signature “Fire Fist”. He is also immune to normal physical strikes, all of which will simply phase through his fire-composed body.\\n\\n#KUROZUMI OROCHI\\n\\nKurozumi Orochi was the former shogun of Wano Country and one of the last members of the Kurozumi Family.Orochi ruled Wano tyrannically until he was deposed by none other than Kaidou, who betrayed him to seize Wano for himself; Orochi survived Kaidou’s attack but was then seemingly killed after two encounters with the Kozuki Family’s Nine Red Scabbards who he knew had been prophesied to overthrow him.Orochi ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allowed him to transform into a full eight-headed snake and a human-eight-headed snake hybrid at will.Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Yamata no Orochi granted him 8 heads/lives in total. In chapter 1048 Denjiro of the 9 Red Scabbards cuts off his eighth and final head.\\n\\n#WHITEBEARD\\n\\nEdward Newgate, more commonly known as “Whitebeard”, was the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates and was known as “The Strongest Man in the World” and “The Man closest to One Piece” after Gol D. Roger’s death. He was a member of the Yonko that ruled over the New World until his death during the Battle of Marineford.Whitebeard ate the Gura Gura no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that made him a “Quake Man” and which was considered the strongest Devil Fruit within the Paramecia class. According to Sengoku, Whitebeard had the power to destroy the world. Soon after his death, the power of the fruit was extracted by Blackbeard through unknown means.\\n\\n#ABSALOM\\n\\nAbsalom was the leader of the Zombie Soldiers and Zombie Generals of Thriller Bark prior to its collapse. He was one of the Mysterious Four and one of the major antagonists of the Thriller Bark Saga.Absalom ate the Suke Suke no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit which gives him the ability to turn himself and other things invisible.Sometime during the timeskip, Absalom became a reporter under the alias Absa. At some point, he was abducted by the Blackbeard Pirates and apparently killed to poach his Devil Fruit powers, with his ability going to Shiryu of the Rain.\\n\\n#KUROZUMI HIGURASHI\\n\\nKurozumi Higurashi was a member of the Kurozumi Family and a major supporter of Kurozumi Orochi. She was killed by Kaido for her interruption in his fight with Kozuki Oden.Higurashi ate the Mane Mane no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that enabled her to perfectly replicate other people’s appearances. She used this fruit to deceive the Wano administration by posing as Kozuki Oden and Sukiyaki and using their likenesses to promote Orochi. She also used this ability in the battlefield effectively, disguising herself as Momonosuke in order to distract Oden.\\n\\n#KUROZUMI SEMIMARU\\n\\nKurozumi Semimaru was a member of the Kurozumi Family and a major supporter of Kurozumi Orochi.Semimaru ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows him to create barriers at will. With this ability, he was able to easily shield Orochi from attacks with an unbreakable barrier.Semimaru eventually died of unknown causes, as his fruit’s powers are currently in the possession of Bartolomeo.\\n\\n#KOZUKI TOKI\\n\\nKozuki Toki was the wife of the daimyo of Kuri, Kozuki Oden, and the mother of Momonosuke and Hiyori. She was killed by Kaido 20 years ago.Toki ate the Toki Toki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that enabled her to send herself and others forward in time.The greatest strength of the fruit is the user’s ability to transport out of dangerous situations by moving into the future, as shown when Toki transported her son and retainers to help them escape from the burning Oden Castle.It is impossible to travel into the past, meaning that all trips forward in time are irreversible.\\n\\nSee more\\n\\nPrevious article The Secret behind the Real Names of all Five Elders\\n\\nNext article Shanks’ motivations in light of the latest chapter\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nin TOP TENTop 10 Strongest Marines In One Piece Series  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENAll One Piece Villains Ranked from Least Evil to Most Evil  Read More\\n\\nin TOP TENTOP 50 Highest Known Bounties Ever in One Piece!

The idea is to tempt others into aiding the capture of the criminal so they can be brought to justice quickly.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nA bounty reflects both the threat and power of an individual. Engaging in activities deemed criminal by the World Government or associating with groups which engage in them is enough to warrant significant bounties, even if the criminal is not powerful themselves. In particular, direct opposition to the World Government, no matter the reason, is treated as a serious offense, and bounties are issued accordingly.\\n\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nAfter a bounty is issued, it can later be increased for several reasons:\\n\\n1-The threat of a person’s observed combat abilities.2-More experienced bounty hunters volunteering to capture the individual or group.3-Further criminal acts beyond the initial one.4-Inspiring criminal acts when provoked or inciting others to act ‘criminally’.5-Having knowledge deemed illegal by the World Government.6-Solely being associated with a notable criminal figure.\\n\\nHere are the 50 Highest Known Bounties ever in One Piece:\\n\\nGol D.

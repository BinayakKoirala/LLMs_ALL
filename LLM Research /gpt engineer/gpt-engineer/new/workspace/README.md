To implement a Sudoku game in Java, we can start by identifying the core classes and their purposes:

1. `SudokuBoard`: Represents the Sudoku game board and manages the state of the game.
2. `Cell`: Represents a single cell in the Sudoku board and stores its value.
3. `GameController`: Handles the game logic and user interactions.
4. `InputValidator`: Validates user input for correctness.
5. `GameRenderer`: Renders the Sudoku board on the console.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents.
